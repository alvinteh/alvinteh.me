Holy but doomed, where is the son of ruse?  
Grow old a farthing art thee thus  
Those lost their window see abhorred then  
There is a with'ring forced to land to  

Lo behold the cursed one  
Bringer of despair, regret and horror  
Draining the steppes of splendor  
It's steeped and debased in  

Blade  
Blade of the loved one  
Come prithee  
Kiss  
Kiss of the dead  
That relieves  

Glorious  

Promised thee power  
Promised thee fancy  
Promised thee favor  
Promised thee destiny  

Promised thee bower  
Promised thee majesty  
Promised thee revel  
Promised thee eternity  

Born unto darkness  
Born unto madness  
Born unto bareness  
Born unto blasphemy  

Thrust unto sadness  
Thrust unto scarcity  
Thrust unto blackness  
Thrust unto enmity  

Hail those who succumb  

Now beget the first fall  
The truth that has fallen from power and glory  
Turning its back on mortals  
Begot frailty  

Blade   
Blade of thy own kin  
Pierc'st thee  
Bleed  
Bleed thee away  
To reprieve  

Glorious  

Took upon fervor  
Took upon malice  
Took upon burden  
Took upon travesty  

Forged into ardor  
Forged into prejudice  
Forged into vengeance  
Forged into infamy  

Devoured by fury  
Devoured by failings  
Devoured by rancor  
Devoured by treachery  

Ended in sorrow  
Ended in agony  
Ended in morose  
Ended in tragedy  

Heed those who succumb
