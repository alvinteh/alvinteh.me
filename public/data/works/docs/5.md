In the darkness that lies within these parts  
There used to be a flame unending  
Tending to lost souls at night  

Hidden within stone walls ones so cold and dark  
A decrepit shelter waiting  
To provide again the light  

Awaiting one to come ignite the spark  
Tend to it with careful kindling  
Restoring the early bright  

Once it grows the fire will slowly make its mark  
Turn from hapless to imposing  
Roaring with an endless might  

At its peak akin to a sun that all will hark  
Hearth for all who weary from traveling  
Monument at its height  

But before it needs one heart's embark  
Will any come and step within  
See beyond its current plight
