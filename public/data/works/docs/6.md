Death has come, it stalks the geists  
Hunter of night with his gleaming eyes  
With one sword he fells, another he flays  
No manner of beast can resist his blade  

But what hath we done to earn this fate?  
Slaves to our nature, our doom awaits  
For no man hast come, no supply of aid  
Counting down days till we lie unafraid  

For our hunter, brood of cold  
Whispered in tales foretold  
Our kind a vice, he won't think twice  
To upend us whole  
With no soul
