Past bleak storm clouds lies a clear sky  
Painted royal blue  

Aft harsh blizzards comes warm sunlight  
With life to imbue  

Lost in dark  
Cry myself to sleep  
Drown in nightmares deep  

Is this the future?  

I can't see  
Clarity within  
Remains to be seen  

A way out of here  

Help me dear  
Take my lonely hand  
Show it's not pretend  

There indeed is light  

Until then  
My soul left to weep  
Nothing worth to keep  

A winter follows  

Without cold there cannot be dew  
Without pain there is no yield  

Holding on throughout the winter  
Awaiting spring when due
