A little flutter with wings of silk,  
Delicate beauty one to behold,  
Seeking an abode of tranquility,  
With the wind it glides and goes.  

Drifting till chancing a roost unsold,  
Trembling descent yet one with grace,  
Perched atop a blossom potentially one day,  
Kindred beings, each other's solace.  

Reverie and bliss outside time and space,  
Nurturing in seeming hope's embrace.  
But night does come and with it ambsace,  
Would they remain and joint troubles face,  
Or flee, elope to another place?
