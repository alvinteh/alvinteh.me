Ave es älouie haesta  // Heaven is absolutely exalted  
Si viv om ver de äde circe // Its reign over all is complete  

Lair vive // Life gifted  
Ho surcle // Grace subject  
Ti odi // World praised  
Ver ägle // Word spread  
Je vide // To establish  

Viv ohm de äde louvei // So is the reign over all written  

Am cede // Wills submit  
Vi circe //  Will complete  
An hohe // Offerings sanctified  
Ver sersi // Necessities fulfilled  
Ji christe // Thus inaugurated  

Ohm verde äde tisteum // All tenets are so declared  

Sold their souls for a second chance  
But never beloved by any man  
The chosen haste and wait no longer  
The lies eclipsed the hunger  
In a twisted quest for life  
Brought about by judgement night  

Blasphemed with the gift of fate  
When death knocks, do not berate  
Filled with sorrow that might have swallowed  
Fed with vengeance, there's no tomorrow  

Swearing false an oath so systemized  
Bleed them all til the silence cries  
Suffocate and make them suffer or more  
Mother demon I’m already on y’all  

Heal or attack, kill them all  
Cast down the righteous call  
Serving causes that I don't believe  
Paving a future I’m sorry that I can't see  

Bless me with the  
Blood that the pure bleed  
All this I cede  
Commit in pain  

Heavens burning  
The world is falling  
Tears inside me  
Drown me now  

Midnight coming  
Means of absolving  
Crown me hither  
Call me bereaved  

A will of pretense hid in grotesque  
Painted a scene one so picturesque  
In truth a vessel filled with morose  
Accursed to wither and ground these black souls  

Brought to witness a secret battlefield  
Where lovers fight till one bends and falls to yield  
The broken steel that makes me stronger  
Devalued life for death I hunger  

In this world is there an end to madness?  
Take upon myself to end this sadness  
A place of wrath lacks truth or meaning  
Behind veils, your god is bleeding  

A just trade for all to seal  
Price one decried yet paid in zeal  
The goal so evil to seduce and satisfy  
When slain your corpse will pacify  

Your chosen vision plagues your honor  
In a love that craves the horror  
Recognized a clouded sense of right  
Killed them all, a judge’s plight  

Death of the martyr  
Placed at the altar  
Blood-filled dark sky  
The devils cry
