Azure blue sky  
Speckled with flame  
A view bold  
For muzzled eyes  
From wading the earth  
From wearing a rose  
To inward rain  
To absolutes of pall  

All for romantic myths  
Plied into children  
Ran off with ferocity  
Inside retraced herself  

And the last scent of the morning so cool  
And the last breath of the body so drew  
And the last scent of the morning so flew  
And the last breath of the body  
   
Found a lighthouse to bide  
Ground gave vista one wide   
Sound of southern waves tide   

Found the sulfur at her side  
Bound the barrel to guide  
Round flew straight through inside  

Aside there on the concrete canvas  
Widened her eyes remained with vacancy  
She bared her end sanguine fluids  
Her head hanging off limp shoulders  

And skipped through times  
The spritz like in a fountain  
The splashing cold
