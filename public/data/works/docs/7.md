Paint the heart with  
Putrid letters  
In a languid sigh  
None obstructing  
Full depravity  

Breed  

Lowly fodder  
Catch on fire  
Fan off history   

Old cold harsh  
A dream of truth  
All cast away  
Shun them liars  
Out of the sacred debris  

Blackness veil  
Cull  
Enter the portal  
And begin the torture  

Matches still  
Down  
Enter the portal  
And regret the torture  

Threatening noise  
Creeping again  
Cutting the vain  
And twisted with pain  

Threatening voice  
Dripping again  
Ripping the vein  
And cast off the pain  

Disgust and shame  
All light doubtful  

Out of passion  
Projecting a belief in vow  
Out of passion  
Protecting a believing doubt  
Asked in secret  
Anger so concerted  

The heart the void  
The heart devoid  

The vision granted  
Breeze  
Poignant  
And silent  

Vested  
Contorted  
Rest come again  
Come to gain  

Rush past  
Past deed  
Sow dissent on my own  

Rushed past  
Hated  
So nascent on my own  

By own blood  

Freed  
Gravitate down  
Cast away by pride  
What I want to behold  

Last torch down  
The silence loud  
What I wanted  
Dark pit down  

Beckoned down  

In ash  
Tarnished  
Low cast bred  
Man fettered and broken down  
Enter the great darkness  
In this lowly dreg  
In distress  
Endless drench  
Endless dread  
End this drear
