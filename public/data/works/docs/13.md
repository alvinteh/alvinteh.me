Away from the bleakness he knew  
Brought a chance to begin anew  

Led him down a path that he drew  
Gave a different view  

Saw through glass  
Saw what could have been  
A future he’d never seen  

Before his own eyes  

In his arms  
Little one of charm  
Its laughter disarm  

Smiling back at him  

With shock wrought  
No one would have thought  
The glimpses that were caught  

That changed his whole world  

Struck in heart  
Wondered where it’d start  
When all fell apart  

Was there a future?  

Painted pictures of skies so blue  
Without dark in any hue  

Pursued dreams he hoped would come true  
Hoping without due
