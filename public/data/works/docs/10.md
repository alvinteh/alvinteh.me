Heard promises tomorrow  
Borrow, fade away day  
You want to change the dream, why?  
You want to change the sacred  

I tried to change my mind, wonder why  
Holding  
Entrapped the will  
I tried to live  

It's like the view  
Across the field  

I tried to touch the living  
I tried to touch the living  

Day approaches, crept in the morning  
Glowing  
Sunlight to chase, sat in the morning  
Growing  

As they pass  

I tried to make it flower  
I tried to put in color  
I tried all my life  

Like vestiges that meant to be  
Like crossing the passage of life  

The passage of life  

Springtime drawing near  
Blossoms coming here  
Raise your head my dear  
Rise in mirth and cheer  

The passing of life  

In comes the new year  
Gone has all the drear  
Wipe away your tear  
Bask in warmth and clear  

Grow  

Wait away no longer  
Arrival of spring  

Coming  
Spring  
Come  
Meadow blooms  

They're coming  
Pray  
Come please  
Pray  
Take this now  

The vibrant reds  
The roses bloom  
The purple shades  
The heathers comb  
The ochre petals  
The lilies groom  
The rainbow hues  
The tulips form  

The purest whites  
The jasmine sight  
The yellows bright  
The daisies light  
The deepest blues  
The iris choose  
The various tones  
The dahlias loose  

The comely golds  
The fennels hold  
The gentle pinks  
The orchids glow  
The deep purples  
The violets stage  
The myriad shades  
The poppies take  

The palest mauves  
The lilacs kiss  
The silver dots  
The statice mix  
The amethyst tinge  
The hyssops make  
The many tints  
The pansies drape  

The petals are lying  
In the flesh at my side  
They vow to take me home  
And past this endless life  

And I can't wait  
Idyllic  
The lifelike reflection like raindrops in mist  
And I can't wait  
Idyllic  
The perfect attraction will glide through the breeze  

Again you saved me from nascent memories  

Floating gently down the stream  
Drifting slowly with the wind  
Glowing softly through sunbeams  

I just want to breathe  
In my heart there it sleeps  
A lifetime of longing  

Endless bliss to savor  
Flowers bloom forever  

I just want to live  
In my heart relishes  
Where pictures take color  

Always and forever  
Bloom
