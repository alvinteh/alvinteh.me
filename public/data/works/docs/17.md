I'm so tired of these tears  
Days gone by without mirth or cheer  
Between worlds a rift  
Growing as minds float away adrift  
As quiet whispers condone  
And no deeds can atone  

Please show me which world's real  
As failings turn to ill  
These thoughts I cannot stand and be unfazed  

As stars rise and fall as the darkness draws near  
Like tides change constantly all of these years  
Storms pass but show no sign of the clear  
You're still left  
But not me  

So used to trepidations of a never-ending kind  
How time spares not the ones that were left behind  
A fleeting glance  
Now but shadows and dreams  
Your voice has taken away  
All sense of tragedy in me  

There is no pain to feel  
These memories can't be real  
There is nothing left to tie me to this place  

Inside I sweep away poignances drear  
Clung on to memories fleeting yet dear  
I pined but there was no one to hear  
You still left  
All of me  

Long lost yet tried to dwell in hopes you would come  
But truth revealed within  
I've been a long time fallen  

As hearts prize sentiments those that endear  
Stayed on while longing for light to appear  
Held on to flights of fancy so sheer  
You still left  
All of me alone  
Leave me alone
