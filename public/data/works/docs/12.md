One long afternoon  
Sitting by the window sill  
Long lost in thought  
And longing to see  
The smile on your face  

One long afternoon  
Watching the raindrops fall  
Reminiscing  
And waiting to feel  
Your warm embrace  

Reliving all the times when we would  

Gaze at each other fondly  
Beating hearts in harmony  
Run along the beaches  
Laughing in revelry  
Dance about the cities  
Waltzing to the melody  
Every single moment perfect, every day with you a tranquility  
When rain clouds were coming  
You opened my eyes to see  
Showed there was no tempest  
Just drops of water for life to be  
Moments with you priceless  
You were the whole world to me  

All the happy memories  
But that was a long past time  

As more seasons pass  
And years go quickly by  
Watch flowers bloom  
And wither after  
The beauty fairs  

As more seasons pass  
And life does carry on  
Closed dreary eyes  
And lived in a dream  
When you were there  

Reliving all the times when we would  

Hold each other closely  
Flowing in rhapsody  
Frolic in the meadows  
Larking in liberty  
Venture to new places  
Making moments merry  
Every single moment perfect, every day with you a tranquility  
Like the springtime blossoms  
You filled my whole heart with glee  
Fragrance so refreshing  
Never had I felt so free  
Romance one so precious  
You were the whole world to me  

All the happy memories  
But that was a long gone time  

We were supposed to be  
Together to this day  
You chased away the rain  
And brought the light to day  
At stars we would smile and gaze  
Savor forever  
No one can ever replace  
Someone like you  

Wishing for all the times we could  

Lie together closely  
Caressing tenderly  
Kiss under the moonlight  
Living out a fantasy  
Pass the years together  
Growing in serenity  
Every single moment perfect, every day with you a tranquillity  
Times we spent together  
Drew close so affectionately  
Cherish all these moments  
Missing you so very dearly  
You were all I treasured  
You were the whole world to me  

All the happy memories  
Will there be a second time?
